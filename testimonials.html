                    <p>A friend recommended me to "A Good Guy Moving". I also checked reviews on Google and Facebook. After that, I knew "A Good Guy Moving" was the company to move my belongings. Jeff was on time, his staff was courteous and friendly and my belongings were moved inner city in two hours from storage to home. I didn't have much to move but we're they quick and they also took respective care of my belongings. I was also impressed they used straps for lifting some of the heavy items. It shows Jeff cares about the investment of his teams health and safety. There were no hidden travel fees and the rate was exactly what I was quoted. Jeff saved me a ton of unnecessary charges. I'm grateful for his honesty and his price. Keep in mind I do realize there is a cost of doing business and I am thankful Jeff has been able to keep his costs low. With that said, his time and effort did not go unnoticed. His company is fantastic.. I would definitely use "A Good Guy Moving" again and again and again.</p>

                    <p>Jeff and his guys were fantastic. Professional, on time (if not early) and truly a great guy to work with. Used him for two moves back to back days and everything arrived in perfect condition and it was -25 the first day and -16 the second. Couldn't have asked for more from Jeff and the crew. Recommend to anyone needing movers.</p>

                    <p>I just completed my 3rd move with Jeff. I have yet to have a poor experience. Showed up on time. Worked hard. Kept our furniture safe, unloaded and re assembled. Everything you want in a moving company. Price was fair, service was excellent. Hit them up for a move. You won't be disappointed.</p>

                    <p>I just had A Good Guy Moving move me today. Him and his helper showed up on time, were friendly and very respectful. Packed up all my household belongings in a timely manner and nothing was damaged. Everything was unloaded at the new location without any issues. They came highly recommended to me and I would definitely use them again. I would for sure recommend them to anyone who is looking for a mover!</p>

                    <p>I have been using this company for YEARS with my business as well as personal moves for myself, friends and family. I can not say enough good things. They are reliable, fast and efficient. All of my clients have had nothing but positive things to say and have even used them after for their own moving. Jeff is a great personable guy, and it took me going through quite a few companies to find one that fit my businesses needs.</p>

                    <p>Best movers I've ever used. I've moved 6 times in the last 15 years and have had some pretty bad movers over the years. These guys have experience, they were punctual, friendly, hardworking and caring with my belongings. Communication was top notch and the cost was fair. I have no plans to move again but if I do I would use a good guy moving in a heart beat. Highly recommend.</p>
